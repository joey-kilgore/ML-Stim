# R Shiny Data Analysis  
Analyze data generated by the simulations by putting data in a folder within /R/Sims/  
From there each folder Sim<num> should have an info.csv and output.csv files that will be loaded when the application is run.  
To run the app  
```
R -e "shiny::runApp('app.R')"  
```
This will load up the data and give you a port number on your machine to access the application. More info on 'runApp' can be found [HERE](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/runApp.html).
